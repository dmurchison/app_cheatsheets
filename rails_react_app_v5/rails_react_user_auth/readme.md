This is a dummy_app containing all the files and contents necessary to have a complete working user-authentication for your react-rails app, I have placed all of the files in the actual directories for simplification.

The frontend will render with a splashpage containing two buttons, one to signup and one to login, once logged in the new splashpage will contain one button, to logout.
